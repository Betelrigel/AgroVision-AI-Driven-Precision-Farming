# PyTorch and torchvision are required for disease detection (wheat model uses PyTorch)
# On Windows and many setups you should install CPU builds via the PyTorch wheel index.
# Use the following command to install compatible CPU-only wheels:
# pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu torch torchvision

# If you prefer to include torch in the requirements file and allow pip to install
# it directly (may work for many setups), add these lines instead of the comments above:
# torch>=2.2.0
# torchvision>=0.19.0

# Load environment variables from a `.env` file (optional helper)
